# AniShowList (frontend edition)

## Introduction
AniShowList is a PERN stack application that would allow you to search for your favorite shows. With an account, you are able to favorite these shows and put them on your watch list.

This application is built to work with [this backend repository](https://github.com/trefynwynd/AniShowList-backend).

This is also the third of four projects for [General Assembly](https://generalassemb.ly)'s SEIR921 cohort.

The Team:
* Jeffrey L. Alejandria
* [Martin Cruz](https://github.com/martinacruz)
* [Edward Gonzales](https://github.com/edwardglez)

## Technologies Used
The frontend consists of the following technologies:
* React.js v17/16.8
* JavaScript (ES6)
* AJAX

### Styling Used:
The majority of styling originated from React styling tutorials from YouTube. The following list are what was used:
* Semantic UI
* Material UI
* Reactstrap
* Styled-Components
* React Icons
* React Modal

We decided to use the [Jikan API](https://jikan.moe/) for our REST API instead of our original API (AniList) due to the fact it was GraphQL-based.

## Unsolved Problems:
During the resubmittal process, we left the "Add to Watching List" button we were using as an button function test as is. This allowed to complete the 3 Model usage requirement. As such, the planned function to allow the change of watching status elsewhere was disabled.

## Future Features:
* Re-enable the change watching status feature and factor it into the frontend design.
