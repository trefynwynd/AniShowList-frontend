# AniShowList (frontend edition)

## Introduction
AniShowList is a PERN stack application that would allow you to search for your favorite shows. With an account, you are able to favorite these shows and put them on your watch list.

This application is built to work with [this repository](https://github.com/trefynwynd/AniShowList-backend).

This is also the third of four projects for [General Assembly](https://generalassemb.ly)'s SEIR921 cohort.

The Team:
* Jeffrey L. Alejandria
* [Martin Cruz](https://github.com/martinacruz)
* [Edward Gonzales](https://github.com/edwardglez)

<p>&nbsp;</p>

## Getting Started
* [Project Board](https://trello.com/b/kdB8JAqb/project-3)


<p>&nbsp;</p>



## Technologies Used
The frontend consists of the following technologies:
* React.js v17/16.8
* JavaScript (ES6)
* Axios

### Styling Used:
The majority of styling originated from React styling tutorials from YouTube. The following list are what was used:
* Semantic UI
* Material UI
* Reactstrap
* Styled-Components
* React Icons
* React Modal

We decided to use the [Jikan API](https://jikan.moe/) for our REST API instead of our original API (AniList) due to the fact it was GraphQL-based.

## Unsolved Problems:
As of the writing of this readme file (2020.11.29), the front-end is mostly up, but incomplete. Our current issue is that we are unable to complete a POST route.
